School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Canada. **KC1 Software defect prediction** One of the NASA Metrics Data Program defect data sets. Data from software for storage management for receiving and processing ground data. Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code. These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality. ### Attribute Information 1. loc : numeric % McCabe's line count of code 2. v(g) : numeric % McCabe ""cyclomatic complexity"" 3. ev(g) : numeric % McCabe ""essential complexity"" 4. iv(g) : numeric % McCabe ""design complexity"" 5. n : numeric % Halstead total operators + operands 6. v : numeric % Halstead ""volume"" 7. l : numeric % Halstead ""program length"" 8. d : numeric % Halstead ""difficulty"" 9. i : numeric % Halstead ""intelligence"" 10. e : numeric % Halstead ""effort"" 11. b : numeric % Halstead 12. t : numeric % Halstead's time estimator 13. lOCode : numeric % Halstead's line count 14. lOComment : numeric % Halstead's count of lines of comments 15. lOBlank : numeric % Halstead's count of blank lines 16. lOCodeAndComment: numeric 17. uniq_Op : numeric % unique operators 18. uniq_Opnd : numeric % unique operands 19. total_Op : numeric % total operators 20. total_Opnd : numeric % total operands 21. branchCount : numeric % of the flow graph 22. problems : {false,true} % module has/has not one or more reported defects ### Relevant papers - Shepperd, M. and Qinbao Song and Zhongbin Sun and Mair, C.
