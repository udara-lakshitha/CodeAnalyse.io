# CodeAnalyse.io: AI-Powered Code Defect Prediction Platform

**CodeAnalyse.io is a full-stack, polyglot microservice application designed to help developers improve code quality. It uses a custom-trained Machine Learning model to analyze Java code and predict the statistical probability of hidden defects.**

This project is a comprehensive showcase of modern software engineering, demonstrating expertise in enterprise backend development with Java, practical data science with Python, and dynamic, type-safe frontend development with React.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

This project utilizes a modern, decoupled microservice architecture. This design pattern provides a clear separation of concerns, allowing each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

üß† The AI Model: From Data to Deployment

The core of this project is the defect prediction model. It is not just a call to an external AI API; it is a model I trained from scratch.

Dataset: The model was trained on the well-known KC1 dataset from the NASA PROMISE repository, containing software metrics and known defect data from real-world Java projects. The non-feature id column was programmatically dropped to ensure only relevant metrics were used for training.

Feature Engineering: A custom "Feature Extractor" was built in Python using the lizard library. It parses raw Java code and calculates the 21 specific software metrics (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity, Lines of Code, Halstead metrics) required by the model. The extractor is robustly designed with getattr to handle cases where a metric may not apply to a given method.

Training: A LogisticRegression classifier from Scikit-learn was trained to learn the statistical relationship between these code metrics and the likelihood of a defect. The resulting trained model and scaler objects were serialized using joblib.

Inference as a Service: The final, trained model is served via a Flask API endpoint. When it receives a new set of metrics, it performs inference to predict the defect probability, demonstrating a complete and practical Machine Learning workflow.
