# CodeAnalyse.io: AI-Powered Code Defect Prediction Platform

**CodeAnalyse.io is a full-stack, polyglot microservice application designed to help developers improve code quality. It uses a custom-trained Machine Learning model to analyze Java code and predict the statistical probability of hidden defects.**

This project is a comprehensive showcase of modern software engineering, demonstrating expertise in enterprise backend development with Java, practical data science with Python, and dynamic, type-safe frontend development with React.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🧠 AI-Powered Defect Prediction:** Submit raw Java code and receive a method-by-method analysis, predicting the probability of each method containing a hidden bug or defect.
-   **🔐 Secure, Stateless Authentication:** Full user registration and login system built with **Spring Security 6** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure API communication.
-   **🌉 Polyglot Microservice Architecture:** A robust system where a **Java (Spring Boot)** backend orchestrates user interactions and communicates via REST API with a specialized **Python (Flask)** microservice that houses the AI model.
-   **📜 Submission Persistence:** All code submissions and their analysis results are persisted in a **MySQL** database, linked to the user's account.
-   **💻 Polished & Responsive Frontend:** A clean, modern, and type-safe single-page application (SPA) built with **React** and **TypeScript**, featuring professional UI components and a custom snackbar notification system.

## 🚀 Project in Action

**Note:** _A stable cloud deployment is currently pending. However, the application is fully functional and the following visuals demonstrate the complete end-to-end user flow running locally._

### **Live Demo GIF**

A user signs up, logs in, is redirected to the dashboard, submits Java code, and receives a real-time analysis from the AI model, complete with professional notifications.
